ðŸ“„ Project Description: Social Media Campaign Performance Dashboard
I developed a Social Media Dashboard in Power BI to analyze and monitor key performance metrics of digital ad campaigns. The goal was to help marketing teams understand ad spending, engagement, and ROI across different age groups, genders, and campaigns.

ðŸŽ¯ What I Did:
Imported and cleaned social media ad performance data using Power Query

- Created custom DAX measures for KPIs such as:

- Total Spent, Clicks, Impressions, Achieved Goals

- ROI, CPC (Cost Per Click), and CTR (Click Through Rate)

Built interactive visuals using:

- Donut charts for category and gender spending

- Line charts for CTR and Clicks over time

- Bar charts by age group and gender performance

- Scatter plots for ROI and campaign-level CPC vs CTR

- Area and histogram charts for interest-based analysis

- Added slicers to filter data by Gender and Campaign ID

ðŸ“Š Key Insights Delivered:
- Which age groups and genders perform better on social platforms

- How ad clicks and CTR vary over time

- ROI comparisons across campaigns and demographics

- Spending vs. performance insights at a glance

ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated:
- Power BI dashboard design & storytelling

- DAX for campaign performance KPIs

- Data visualization for digital marketing metrics

- Cross-filtering and dynamic interaction using slicers

This dashboard enables marketing teams to make data-driven decisions about targeting, budget allocation, and ad effectiveness.
